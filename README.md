# E-Commerce Platform 

##  Project Status: Backend complete | Frontend Incomplete  
This project was created as a **learning exercise** to explore:  
- **Photo uploads with Cloudinary**  
- **Authentication & authorization with Keycloak**  
- **Spring Boot & React full-stack integration**  

The **backend is fully functional**, but the frontend is **not fully completed**.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives  
- Upload and manage **images using Cloudinary**  
- Implement **authentication & authorization with Keycloak**  
- Build a **Spring Boot REST API** for an e-commerce system  
- Integrate **React frontend with a Spring Boot backend**  

##  Features Implemented  
âœ… **Backend Functionalities**:  
- Product management (CRUD operations)  
- Cart service (add/remove items)  
- User authentication & authorization with Keycloak  
- Cloudinary integration for product image uploads  

âœ… **Frontend (Partially Completed)**:  
- Basic UI setup in React  
- API integration for products  

## Technologies Used  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Java  
- **Frontend:** React (not fully completed)  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Authentication:** Keycloak  
- **File Uploads:** Cloudinary  

## Why I Stopped Development  
I mainly built this project to **learn Cloudinary integration and Keycloak authentication**. Since I successfully implemented these features on the backend, I decided not to fully complete the frontend.  

## Notes  
- **The backend is functional** and can be used as a reference.  
- The frontend is **not complete**.
